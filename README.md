# Super Soccer Showdown

The Star Wars and Pokemon universes have collided and a big soccer tournament is being planned to
settle which universe is best.
You are tasked with creating a solution that can generate random teams for each universe!

## Team Generator

Using the publicly available APIs https://swapi.dev and https://pokeapi.co create a solution that can
generate random SuperSoccer Showdown teams for each universe, such that:

1. Each team consist of 5 players
1. Each player can play only one position
1. Each player has three stats:

- _Name_
- _Weight_ (Kg)
- _Height_ (cm)

4. Each team has three different player types:

- _Goalie_: The tallest player
- _Defence_: The heaviest players
- _Offence_: The shortest players

5. Each team can be configured with different lineups (the number of attackers and defenders)

## Developement

### Installing the project

Having docker on the local machine is a requirement.

1. In the root of the project, run the following command:

```
docker compose up --build
```

2. After the build is finished, run the following commands

```
docker compose exec django-web bash
cd src
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Running the project

1. In the root of the porject, run the following command:

```
docker compose up
```

2. Go to http://localhost:8000/

### Running the tests

In the root of the project, the following command can be run:

```
docker compose run django-web pytest
```

## Architecture

The project is built on top of Django and leverages Django Rest Framework for exposing API endpoints.

For generating the teams, there is a `tournament` library within the project that can be used independently of the Django project

### Fetching players from Pokemon API

The following snippet of code can be used to fetch a specified number of players from Pokemon API

```
from tournament.clients.pokemon import PokemonClient
poke_client = PokemonClient(num_players=5)
players = poke_client.fetch_players()
```

### Fetching players from StarWars API

The following snippet of code can be used to fetch a specified number of players from StarWars API

```
from tournament.clients.star_wars import StarWarsClient
sw_client = StarWarsClient(num_players)
sw_players = sw_client.fetch_players()

```

### Building a team

Once we have players, we can build a team.

```
from tournament.team import Team
team = Team.build_team(players, num_attackers=2, num_defenders=2)

```

On the `team` object multiple properties about that team are available:

- `attacker` - a random attacker
- `defender` - a random defender
- `goalie` - the goalie of the team
- `attackers` - all attackers whitin the team
- `defenders` - all defenders within the team
- `team_power` - the sum of a new statistic 'player soccer power'

### Play a match

If we have more teams, a match can be played between two teams.

```
from tournament.match import Match
match = Match.play(home_team=poke_team, away_team=sw_team)
```

On the `match` object, the `highlights` of the match can be found.

## Things to improve

The primary performance bottleneck of the application is the reliance on external requests to the Star Wars and Pok√©mon APIs. To speed up team generation, one effective approach is to fetch the necessary data asynchronously. This can be achieved in various ways, such as implementing a management command that runs as a scheduled cron job. The command can periodically retrieve data, check for updates in the APIs, and update the local dataset accordingly.

If we store this data in a local database, adopting a master/slave architecture can significantly improve efficiency. By directing all read queries to a slave instance, we can reduce the load on the primary database while maintaining performance. Additionally, as the application scales and gains more users, implementing a caching layer on top of the database can further optimize response times and ensure a seamless user experience.
